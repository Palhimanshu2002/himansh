    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Graphical User Interface</h2>
    <P>The most widely used type of Ul in use today is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It accepts input through the key and mouse and displays the output on the user's computer screen. The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.</P>

    <p>The most common elements of GUI include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Window</h2>
            It is an area on the screen that displays information. Contents in a window are displayed in the form of icons or lists. According to the size of the screen, windows can be minimized, resized, or maximized. They can be moved anywhere on the screen. A window may have one or more windows as its children. These child windows are drawn within the client area of the parent window.
            
        </li>

        <li><h2>Icon</h2>
            It is a small picture that represents a software application or a hardware device. An application window opens on clicking or double-clicking these icons.
            
        </li>

        <li><h2>Menu</h2>
            It is a list of choices presented to the user. A menu is placed at a visible (generally top) inside the application.
            
        </li>

        <li><h2>Pointer/Cursor</h2>
            It is an onscreen symbol that represents movement of a device that the user controls to select windows, icons, and menus.
        </li>
        
    </ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Voice-controlled Interface(VUI)</h2>
<p>Certainly! A Voice User Interface (VUI) enables spoken human interaction with computers.</p>
<ul>
<li><h2>Defination of Voice-controlled Interface (VUI)</h2>
    Definition: A VUI allows users to interact with a system using voice or speech commands. Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa are examples of VUI.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Gesture-Based Interface(GUI)</h2>
<p>Certainly! A Voice User Interface (VUI) enables spoken human interaction with computers.</p>
<ul>
<li><h2>Defination of Gesture-Based Interface (GUI)</h2>
    Gesture-based UI refers to using specific physical gestures in order to operate an interface. Take your smartphone for instance. You can already interact with your phone without using the keypad by swiping, tapping, pinching, and scrolling. The latest smart devices also allow for “touchless” gestures where users can scroll or click without ever touching the screen.

    <h3>UI DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Structure</li>
        <li>Simplicity</li>
        <li>Visibility</li>
        <li>Feedback</li>
        <li>Tolerance</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Structure Principle</h2>
    <div style="border: 2px gray solid; padding: 5px;">

        <h4>This principle is concerned with overall UI architecture.</h4>

        The design of the inerface should be visually, theoretically, and linguistically clear.

        <h2>Tips/Tecniques to support the Structure Principle</h2>
        <p>You should group the logically connected item to communicate and separate unrelated item to achieve visual
            organization.</p>

        <ui>
            <li>Design page-specific navigation and access to information.</li>
            <li>Keep the screen less cluttered and easier to understand.</li>
            <li>Present the flow of action,information,rsponses, and visual preparations in a sensible order that is
                easy to remember and place in context.</li>

        </ui>

    </div>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Simplicity Principle</h2>
    <div style="border: 2px gray solid; padding: 5px;">

        <ui>
            <li>The design Should be simple to learn and use.</li>
            <li>It should include only the elements that are most important for communication.</li>
            <li> It should also make common task easy to perform</li>
            <li> It should provide good shortcuts that are meaningfully related to longer procedures.</li>


        </ui>

        <h2>Tips/Tecniques to support the Simplicity Principle</h2>

        <p>Ensure that you create natural design, which can be easily understood by the user based on their past
            experiences.</p>
        <h4>Make use of colors and fonts carefully</h4>
